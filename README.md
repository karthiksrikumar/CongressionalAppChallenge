## Project Backend for AI Model

This repository contains the backend code for my AI model, the key part of DriveAEye, which handles the core functionality of the application. The model is built to manage various tasks, such as Object Detection, using efficient algorithms and optimized processes.

## API Key Usage

This project relies on several private API keys for full functionality. Due to the nature of these keys being private, they are **not included in this repository**. These keys are required to run many of the external components and services connected to this backend.

If this code were made public, exposing these keys would compromise the security of the project. As a result, the keys would be disabled, affecting both the public version and my private access.

Since this backend forms the primary part of the project, the rest of the system depends on these integrations to function.
